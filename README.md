# Match-Group-Valuation
AS OF 8/2/2022
In this project, I performed a detailed financial analysis and valuation of Match Group (MTCH), focusing on revenue growth, operating margins, and strategic positioning in the online dating industry. 
Utilizing methods like DCF modeling and EV/Sales ratio analysis, I provided a comprehensive assessment of Match Group's market value and financial health. 
The analysis concluded with a balanced 'HOLD' recommendation, considering the company's strong market presence against potential challenges such as slowing user growth and regulatory factors.
